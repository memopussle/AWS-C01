### IT Terminology

- Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other
- Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
- Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network

### Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- Through a cloud services platform with **pay-as-you-go pricing**
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost **instantly**
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of **application services**

#### AWS owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

### 5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing


|On-demand self service     | Broad network access          | Multi-tenancy and resource pooling  |Rapid elasticity and scalability |Measured service |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|-----|-----|
| Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provide      | Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms |  Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy.Customers are serviced from the same physical resources |Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed, Quickly and easily scale based on demand |Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used |
